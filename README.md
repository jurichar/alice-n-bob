Alice & Bob - Cloud take-home assignment
==================================

This repository contains the technical tests for Cloud team developer positions.

It is divided into two parts: **backend** and **frontend**.

⚠️ For a backend software engineer position, only send the content of the backend folder to the candidate.

⚠️ For a full-stack developer position, make sure to send both the backend and frontend folders.

Each folder contains its own `SUBJECT.md` file with details about the technical test and the expectations.

# Backend

# Frontend

The frontend test complements the backend test and requires the candidate to develop a user interface for the drone delivery API using React.
